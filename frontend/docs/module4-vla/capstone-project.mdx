## Overview

The Capstone Project is the culmination of all the knowledge and skills gained throughout the modules. It provides a practical application of the concepts of ROS 2, digital twin simulation (Gazebo/Unity), NVIDIA Isaac AI, and Vision-Language-Action (VLA) capabilities. The goal is to develop a simulated humanoid robot that can autonomously execute complex tasks based on natural language commands.

## Project Goal

To create a simulated autonomous humanoid robot capable of:
1.  **Receiving voice commands**: Understanding human instructions through speech recognition (e.g., using Gemini-powered speech recognition).
2.  **Cognitive planning**: Translating natural language goals into a sequence of executable robot actions using Large Language Models (LLMs).
3.  **Path planning and navigation**: Autonomously moving through a simulated environment, avoiding obstacles, and reaching target locations (leveraging Nav2 and potentially Isaac ROS).
4.  **Object identification and manipulation**: Using computer vision to identify specific objects and interacting with them (e.g., picking up, placing down).
5.  **Integrating all modules**: Demonstrating a cohesive system where perception, planning, and action are seamlessly orchestrated.

## Key Phases

### 1. Speech-to-Text Integration

-   Implement an audio pipeline to capture speech.
-   Utilize Gemini-powered speech recognition to convert spoken commands into text.
-   Ensure robustness to different voices and environmental conditions.

### 2. LLM-based Task Planning

-   Design prompts for an LLM to decompose a high-level natural language command (e.g., "Make me a coffee") into a sequence of low-level robot actions.
-   Define a set of robot action primitives (e.g., `navigate_to_location`, `detect_object`, `grasp_object`, `open_door`).
-   Parse the LLM's output (e.g., JSON) into a format executable by the robot's control system.

### 3. Simulation Environment Setup

-   Set up a realistic simulation environment in Gazebo or Unity (or Isaac Sim) for the humanoid robot.
-   Integrate the humanoid robot model (URDF) into the simulation.
-   Populate the environment with objects relevant to the capstone tasks.

### 4. Perception and Navigation

-   Implement computer vision algorithms for object detection and recognition.
-   Integrate ROS 2 Nav2 for global and local path planning within the simulated environment.
-   Utilize simulated sensors (LiDAR, depth cameras) for obstacle avoidance and localization.
-   Consider applying Isaac ROS acceleration for perception tasks.

### 5. Manipulation and Control

-   Develop control strategies for the humanoid robot's manipulators (arms, hands) to interact with objects.
-   Address challenges related to inverse kinematics, grasp planning, and force control in simulation.
-   Ensure stability and balance during manipulation tasks.

## Example Task Flow

**Voice Command**: "Robot, please clear the table and put the empty cup in the sink."

1.  **Gemini Speech Recognition**: "Robot, please clear the table and put the empty cup in the sink."
2.  **LLM Planning**:
    *   `action: navigate_to_location, parameters: { location: "table" }`
    *   `action: detect_object, parameters: { object_type: "empty cup" }`
    *   `action: grasp_object, parameters: { object_name: "empty cup" }`
    *   `action: navigate_to_location, parameters: { location: "sink" }`
    *   `action: place_object, parameters: { object_name: "empty cup" }`
    *   `action: navigate_to_location, parameters: { location: "home_position" }`
3.  **ROS 2 Execution**: Each planned action is translated into ROS 2 commands, executed by the simulated humanoid, utilizing its navigation, perception, and manipulation capabilities.
