## Overview

This section explores how **Large Language Models (LLMs)** can be leveraged for high-level **cognitive planning** in robotics. The goal is to translate abstract natural language goals (e.g., "Clean the room," "Make coffee") into a concrete sequence of executable robot actions that can be understood and executed via ROS 2 commands.

## Key Concepts

### LLMs as Task Planners

-   **Goal Decomposition**: LLMs can break down a complex, high-level task into a series of smaller, more manageable sub-tasks.
-   **Common Sense Reasoning**: LLMs possess vast amounts of world knowledge, enabling them to infer logical steps and necessary conditions for completing tasks, even if not explicitly stated.
-   **Contextual Understanding**: They can interpret the nuances of natural language commands, adapting plans based on context or prior interactions.

### Translating Natural Language to Robot Actions

-   **Action Primitives**: The robot system needs a predefined set of "action primitives" – low-level functions that the robot can actually perform (e.g., `move_to_location`, `pick_up_object`, `open_gripper`).
-   **Prompt Engineering**: The core challenge lies in designing effective prompts for the LLM that guide it to output a sequence of these action primitives, along with their necessary parameters, in a structured format (e.g., JSON).
-   **Feedback Loop**: A robust system would include a feedback loop where the robot executes actions, observes results, and potentially asks the LLM for corrections or refinements if a plan fails or needs adaptation.

### Integration with ROS 2

-   The output from the LLM (e.g., a JSON list of actions) needs to be parsed and translated into ROS 2 commands. This involves:
    -   Calling ROS 2 services for immediate actions.
    -   Publishing messages to ROS 2 topics to initiate continuous actions.
    -   Interfacing with existing ROS 2 navigation or manipulation stacks.
