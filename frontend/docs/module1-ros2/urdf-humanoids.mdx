## Overview

This section introduces **URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)**, an XML format used in ROS 2 to describe the physical and kinematic properties of a robot. Understanding URDF is crucial for simulating robots, path planning, and visualizing their structure, especially for complex humanoid robots.

## Key Concepts

### What is URDF?

-   **XML-based Description**: URDF defines a robot as a set of rigid bodies (links) connected by joints.
-   **Links**: Represent the physical segments of the robot (e.g., torso, upper arm, forearm, hand). Each link has mass, inertia, visual (appearance), and collision (physical interaction) properties.
-   **Joints**: Define the kinematic and dynamic properties of the connections between links (e.g., revolute, prismatic, fixed). They specify how links move relative to each other.
-   **Kinematics**: Describes the motion of a robot without considering the forces that cause the motion. URDF helps define forward and inverse kinematics.
-   **Dynamics**: Describes the relationship between forces and motion. URDF provides properties like mass and inertia for dynamic simulations.

### Components of a URDF File

A typical URDF file includes:
-   `<robot>` tag: The root element, defining the robot's name.
-   `<link>` tags: Describe each rigid body.
    -   `<visual>`: Defines the graphical representation (e.g., geometry, color).
    -   `<collision>`: Defines the collision geometry (used for physics simulation).
    -   `<inertial>`: Defines the mass and inertia tensor.
-   `<joint>` tags: Describe the connections between links.
    -   `type`: (e.g., `revolute`, `continuous`, `prismatic`, `fixed`).
    -   `<origin>`: Specifies the transform from the parent link to the child link.
    -   `<axis>`: Defines the axis of rotation for revolute/continuous joints or translation for prismatic joints.
    -   `<limit>`: Specifies the joint's movement limits (for revolute/prismatic).

### URDF for Humanoid Robots

Humanoid robots are particularly complex to describe in URDF due to their many degrees of freedom and intricate kinematic chains (e.g., legs, arms, spine, head).
-   **Hierarchical Structure**: Humanoids typically have a complex tree-like structure, starting from a base link (e.g., pelvis) and branching out to limbs.
-   **Inverse Kinematics**: Essential for humanoids to perform tasks like grasping or walking, where the desired end-effector position is known, and the joint angles need to be calculated.
-   **Collision Models**: Crucial for humanoids to interact with the environment and avoid self-collisions.

## Example

```xml
<!-- Example: Simple URDF for a robot link -->
<robot name="my_robot">
  <link name="base_link">
    <visual>
      <geometry>
        <box size="0.6 0.4 0.2"/>
      </geometry>
      <material name="blue">
        <color rgba="0 0 0.8 1"/>
      </material>
    </visual>
    <collision>
      <geometry>
        <box size="0.6 0.4 0.2"/>
      </geometry>
    </collision>
    <inertial>
      <mass value="10"/>
      <origin xyz="0 0 0"/>
      <inertia ixx="1" ixy="0" ixz="0" iyy="1" iyz="0" iyz="0" izz="1"/>
    </inertial>
  </link>
</robot>
```
