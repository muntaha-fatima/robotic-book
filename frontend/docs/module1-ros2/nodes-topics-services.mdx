## Overview

This section focuses on the fundamental communication primitives in **ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2)**: Nodes, Topics, and Services. These concepts form the backbone of how different components of a robotic system interact.

## Key Concepts

### ROS 2 Nodes

-   **Nodes**: Executable processes that perform computation. In a ROS 2 system, each node is responsible for a specific task (e.g., a camera driver node, a navigation node, a motor control node). This modularity allows for robust and distributed development.

### ROS 2 Topics

-   **Topics**: A publish/subscribe mechanism for asynchronous, many-to-many communication between nodes.
    -   **Publishers**: Nodes that send messages to a specific topic.
    -   **Subscribers**: Nodes that receive messages from a specific topic.
    -   Messages are typed, ensuring data consistency.

### ROS 2 Services

-   **Services**: A request/reply mechanism for synchronous, one-to-one communication between nodes.
    -   **Clients**: Nodes that send a request to a service.
    -   **Servers**: Nodes that provide a service and send a response.
    -   Useful for operations that require a direct response, like triggering an action or querying data.

## Example

```python
# Example: ROS 2 Publisher Node (Python)
import rclpy
from rclpy.node import Node
from std_msgs.msg import String

class MinimalPublisher(Node):

    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__('minimal_publisher')
        self.publisher_ = self.create_publisher(String, 'topic', 10)
        timer_period = 0.5  # seconds
        self.timer = self.create_timer(timer_period, self.timer_callback)
        self.i = 0

    def timer_callback(self):
        msg = String()
        msg.data = 'Hello, world! %d' % self.i
        self.publisher_.publish(msg)
        self.get_logger().info('Publishing: "%s"' % msg.data)
        self.i += 1

def main(args=None):
    rclpy.init(args=args)
    minimal_publisher = MinimalPublisher()
    rclpy.spin(minimal_publisher)
    minimal_publisher.destroy_node()
    rclpy.shutdown()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```
