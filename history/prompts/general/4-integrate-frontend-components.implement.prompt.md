## Prompt

## Response snapshot

I have integrated the `RAGChatbot`, `UrduTranslateButton`, and `PersonalizeButton` components into the Docusaurus frontend.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Integrated all specified frontend components into the Docusaurus project.
- 🧪 Tests: No new tests were added.
- 📁 Files: Modified 3 existing files.
- 🔁 Next prompts: The next step would be to ensure all functionalities are working end-to-end and to potentially add more content or refine styling.
- 🧠 Reflection: The integration process was successful, demonstrating how to add custom components to Docusaurus.
