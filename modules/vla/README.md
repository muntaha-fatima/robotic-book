# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

## Overview
This module handles the convergence of LLMs and Robotics, connecting language understanding to physical actions.

## Focus
- Voice-to-Action: Using speech recognition for voice commands
- Cognitive Planning: Using LLMs to translate natural language ("Clean the room") into a sequence of ROS 2 actions
- Capstone Project: The Autonomous Humanoid
- Integration of perception, cognition, and action

## Components

### Voice Processing
- Speech-to-text conversion
- Intent recognition from voice commands
- Integration with ASR systems
- Language understanding for robotics commands

### Cognitive Planning
- Natural language to action sequence conversion
- Task decomposition and planning
- Integration with RAG system for knowledge access
- Execution monitoring and adjustment

### Capstone Project
- Autonomous humanoid execution of complex tasks
- Multi-modal understanding (vision + language)
- Real-time adaptation to environment
- Human-robot interaction capabilities
