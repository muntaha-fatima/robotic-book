# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

## Overview
This module implements the middleware for robot control using ROS 2 (Robot Operating System).

## Focus
- ROS 2 Nodes, Topics, and Services
- Bridging Python Agents to ROS controllers using rclpy
- Understanding URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) for humanoids
- Communication between AI components and physical robot

## Components

### ROS 2 Nodes
- Navigation nodes for humanoid movement
- Sensor processing nodes
- Control nodes for actuator management

### URDF Models
- Humanoid robot description files
- Joint configurations for bipedal movement
- Sensor placements and specifications

### AI Integration
- Interfaces to connect LLM outputs to ROS actions
- Semantic-to-physical command translation
- Path planning and execution
